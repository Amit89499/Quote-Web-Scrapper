            <h1>Web Scraping</h1>
            <p>Data scraping, also known as web scraping, is the process of importing information from a website into a
                spreadsheet or local file saved on your computer. Itâ€™s one of the most efficient ways to get data from
                the web, and in some cases to channel that data to another website.</p>
